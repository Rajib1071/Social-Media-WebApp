# Social Media Web Application

This is a social media web application built using React, Node.js, WebSocket, and MongoDB. It allows users to register, log in, create posts, follow/unfollow other users, and view posts from followed users in real-time.

## Features

- User Authentication and Authorization
- User Profiles and Personalization
- News Feed and Timeline
- Post Creation and Interaction
- Search and Discovery(not done yet)
- Notifications and Real-time Updates(not done yet)

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side development
- Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js
- WebSocket: Protocol for real-time communication between client and server
- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user data
- Mongoose: Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Frontend development technologies
- Git: Version control system
- MongoDB Atlas: Cloud-based MongoDB database

## Getting Started

### Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository.

   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/Rajib1071/Social-Media-WebApp.git>
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up the MongoDB database and provide the connection string in the configuration file.
4. Start the backend server using `npm start`.
5. Navigate to the frontend directory and start the React development server using `npm start`.
6. Access the web application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Folder Structure

- `backend`: Contains the backend server code.
- `frontend`: Contains the frontend React code.

## Future Work

In the future, the following enhancements and technologies can be considered to further improve the social media web application:

- **Authentication with JWT**: Implementing authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) can enhance security and user authentication. JWTs can be used to generate and validate tokens for user authentication, allowing for stateless and secure authentication between the client and server.

These enhancements and technologies can add additional value to the application by improving authentication security, scalability, real-time processing, log analysis, caching, and overall system performance. They also enable efficient deployment and management of the application through containerization and DevOps practices.
